# Abstract
**Abstract**—We present a novel cryptography architecture based on memristor crossbar array, binary hypervectors, and neural network. Utilizing the stochastic and unclonable nature of memristor crossbar and error tolerance of binary hypervectors and neural network, implementation of the algorithm on memristor crossbar simulation is made possible. We demonstrate that with increasing dimension of the binary hypervectors, the nonidealities in memristor circuit can be effectively controlled. At thefine level of controlled crossbar non-ideality, noise from memristor circuit can be used to encrypt data while being sufficiently interpretable by neural network for decryption. We applied our algorithm on image cryptography for proof of concept, and to text en/decryption with 100% decryption accuracy despite of crossbar noises. Our work shows the potential and feasibility of using memristor crossbar as an unclonable stochastic encoder unit of cryptography on top of its existing functionality as a vector matrix multiplication acceleration device.

# Introduction
Memristors are non-volatile, configurable memory devices [1-2]. Their ability to permanently store variable conductance information makes them good candidates to build analog vector matrix multiplications (VMM) crossbar accelerators for in-memory computing. The crossbar performs VMM in O(1) and overcomes von Neumann bottleneck with in-memory computing [3], which enables many edge computing applications in machine learning such as CNN [6], LSTM [7] and neurmorphic computing [9]. However, despite their high efficiency, low footprint, and low power consumption [9-11], memristor crossbar suffer non-ideality issues such as sneak path current, device variability, stuck conductance, and cycle-to-cycle variability [12-15]. In some literature, nonideality and behaviours of memristors are studied and their stochasiticity are exploit for hardware security applications [15] such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) [16-18] and chaotic circuits [19-20]. Despite algorithms proposed in these studies covers from generating stochastic sequences for hardware verification to public and private key cryptography, none of which have touched on using memristor crossbar’s VMM operation to encrypt the data directly. In in-memory hyperdimensional encryption, we investigate the feasibility of using memristor crossbar’s stochastic VMM operation for data encryption. Encrypting data directly with memristor crossbar poses a challenge for decryption because of the cycle to cycle variability can result in inconsistent cipher text for the same input. On the other hand, such randomness can be beneficial as it prevents repetitiveness of the encrypted text. In-memory hyperdimensional computing
